<summary> Networks vs Natural Graphs?</summary> 
  -- Social Network where we connected with the people we know and the people they know etc.
  -- Communications and Transactions where we make phone calls, financial transactions etc.
  -- Biomedicine where the interactions between genes/proteins regulate life
  -- How our thoughts are captured by the hidden connections between the billions of neurons.
  -- Information with relational structure:
	  -- Information/knowledge: Once is generally linked to another
	  -- Software
	  -- Similarity Networks: Connecting similar data points 
	  -- Relational Structures: Molecules, scene graphs, 3D shapes, physics-particle simulation etc.
  Note: Sometimes the distinction between a network and a graph is blurred.

<summary>Why are networks complex?</summary> 
  -- In comparison to text or images, which has spacial locality such as a pixel to the left or to the right, word that came before or the word that comes after, networks can be of arbitrary size and topological structure unlike in grids or arrays.
	  -- While modern deep learning toolbox is designed for simple sequences and grids
  -- There cannot be any reference points and no fixed node ordering.
  -- They are often dynamic and have multi modal features.

<summary>What is representational learning?</summary> 
  -- Here the goal is to learn the function f that takes the node u and maps it to the d dimensional real valued vectors.
	  -- f:u --> R^d -- To learn a neural network
  -- Here the similar nodes in the nodes are embedded close together.

<summary>What are the applications are graphs?</summary> 
  -- There are many tasks attached to graphs such as graph level prediction and generation
  -- The same can be scaled down to community or sub graph, node-level and edges-level
  -- Applications in areas such as protein folding where predicting the protein's 3D structure solely based on its amino acid sequence can/do have a huge impact in drug discovery etc.
	  -- Spatial Graph: Where Nodes are the amino acids in the protein sequence and edges are the proximity between amino acids (residues)
  -- PinSage: Graph-based recommender
	  -- 
  -- Drug Side effects
  -- Drug Discovery
  -- Traffic prediction
