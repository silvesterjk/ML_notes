* A set is a collection of unordered and yet distinct objects.
* Usually added inside { }, these objects are called elements.
* ∈ -- Belongs & a striked through /∈ -- Does not belong
	* If object ω belongs to set A, we say “ω belongs to A” and write ω ∈ A. Conversely, if ω is not in A, we write ω /∈ A.
